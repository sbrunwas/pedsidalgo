      Perform:
      - Nasal suction with olive tip aspirator and saline
      - Antipyretic if temperature >=38 C

      Consider:
      - PCR swabs for COVID, RSV, and/or influenza

      Escalate care:
      - Start high-flow nasal cannula at 0.5-2 L/kg/min, 21-30% FiO2
      - May increase FiO2 to maintain O2 saturation >=90% while awake
      - If age >=12 months and concern for acute bronchospasm, may consider albuterol trial
      - Call inpatient pediatrics attending to discuss admission vs transfer
